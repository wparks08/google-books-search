# Google Books Search

 Google Books Search is an application built on the MERN stack. It allows users to
 search for books from the Google Books API, and provides links to view the book, or save it
 in the application's database.

## Organization

The back-end of the application runs on Node.js, using the Express framework. Data is persisted to a MongoDB database.

The front-end is built using React and the Material-UI library.

Data is communicated between the front-end and back-end via API routes, making the front-end and back-end independent from each other.

## Accessing the App

Google Books Search is currently deployed to Heroku.
